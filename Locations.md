# World Locations: The Fragmented Realm

## Major Continents

### Western Hemisphere
- **Valia**: A vast, arid continent with rolling plains and mesa formations. Notable for its nomadic tribes and ancient ruins that predate recorded history.
- **Curmire**: Mountainous region with dense fog-forests and deep ravines. Home to fungi-based ecosystems and bioluminescent flora that serve as the main light source.
- **Iremland**: Perpetually cold tundra dotted with geothermal springs. Inhabitants have developed unique heat-retention architecture and cold-resistant agriculture.

### Eastern Hemisphere
- **Hound**: The largest verdant region, characterized by sprawling grasslands and scattered forests. Considered the breadbasket of the world with the most temperate climate.
- **Mosvikland**: Densely forested region with trees that grow to impossible heights. Canopy-dwelling civilizations rarely interact with ground dwellers.
- **Zirk'u**: Desert region with crystalline formations that amplify and refract sunlight. Nocturnal civilization with advanced celestial navigation systems.

## Notable Regions

### Northern Territories
- **Dagmar**: Floating island maintained by ancient technology or magic (disputed origin). Serves as neutral diplomatic ground for warring factions.
- **Apton**: Archipelago with unique micro-climates on each island. Trading hub where rare resources from all regions are exchanged.
- **Moria**: Narrow isthmus connecting eastern and western hemispheres. Heavily fortified with toll gates controlled by mercenary guilds.

### Central Lands
- **Bleak**: Depression-zone with the world's lowest elevation. Air is thick and mist-laden, obscuring vision beyond ten paces.
- **Sout**: Disputed territory between multiple factions. Landscape constantly shifts due to ongoing terraforming conflicts.
- **Ces'ta**: Region of impossibly precise geometric landforms. Home to the Mathematical Monastery where reality-altering equations are studied.

### Southern Territories
- **Dradowia**: Island chain with unstable reality pockets. Travelers report experiencing different timelines simultaneously.
- **Asfra Marda**: Peninsula of extreme gravitational fluctuations. Inhabitants have evolved specialized limbs for anchoring themselves during gravity storms.
- **Medval**: Mountainous archipelago where rare minerals cause electromagnetic disruptions. Communication relies on crystal resonance rather than conventional methods.

## Minor Noted Locations
- **Torehb**: City-state built inside a dormant volcano. Renowned for metallurgy and geomancy.
- **Yehelia**: Island research enclave where interdimensional studies are conducted. Highly restricted access.
- **Ald**: Peninsula of perpetual twilight. Flora has evolved to use starlight for photosynthesis.

## Unique Geographical Features
- **The Sout Line**: Visible from space, a perfect curve separating disparate biomes across the central continent.
- **Aslan's Tear**: Inland sea with water that flows upward rather than downward, creating reverse waterfalls.
- **Boundary Waters**: Ocean currents that flow in impossible patterns, creating natural barriers between major continents.

## Scale Reference
- As noted on the map, distances are measured in miles with scale markers at 120, 240, 360, 480, and 600.
- Travel times between regions vary dramatically due to reality distortions and environmental hazards.
- The entire visible world spans approximately 1,200 miles at its widest point.
