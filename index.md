  <h2>About Melneri</h2>

  <p>In the vast expanse of creation, where reality folds upon itself like pages in an ancient tome, there exists a world poised upon the back of a cosmic entity. This is Melneri, a realm where magic flows like water, where the mundane and the extraordinary dance together in endless waltz.</p>

  <p>The lands of Melneri stretch from the frost-bitten Northlands to the sun-scorched Dunes of Eternal Thirst. Between lie forests that whisper secrets of old, mountains that scrape the very heavens, and oceans that hide civilizations in their deepest trenches.</p>

  <p>Here, the peoples of a hundred nations forge their destinies amidst gods and monsters alike. Some seek power, others knowledge, and many simply strive to live another day in a world where wonder and terror often wear the same face.</p>
