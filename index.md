## About Melneri

<span class="decorative-letter">I</span>n the vast expanse of creation, where reality folds upon itself like pages in an ancient tome, there exists a world poised upon the back of a cosmic entity. This is Melneri, a realm where magic flows like water, where the mundane and the extraordinary dance together in endless waltz.

The lands of Melneri stretch from the frost-bitten Northlands to the sun-scorched Dunes of Eternal Thirst. Between lie forests that whisper secrets of old, mountains that scrape the very heavens, and oceans that hide civilizations in their deepest trenches.

Here, the peoples of a hundred nations forge their destinies amidst gods and monsters alike. Some seek power, others knowledge, and many simply strive to live another day in a world where wonder and terror often wear the same face.
